# Investigating-the-Dynamics-of-Coupled-Oscillators
This project models and analyzes the dynamics of coupled oscillators under varying boundary conditions (semi-fixed or free ends) using numerical integration. It provides detailed visualizations of the system's behavior across different oscillator configurations, contributing to computational physics studies and wave dynamics research.
